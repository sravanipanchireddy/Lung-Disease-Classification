# Lung-Disease-Classification
Abstract
In medical imaging research, automated analysis of chest X-ray (CXR) images for the identification of lung illness has become important. However, CXR image interpretation can be difficult and subjective, frequently requiring radiologists with specialized training. Using advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, there has been an increasing interest in creating automated systems for the classification of lung illnesses from CXR pictures in recent years. This project  primary goal is to categorize and detect lung conditions such  pneumonia, Tuberculosis, corona virus, and normal and give the precautions about the disease. The dataset consists of 8,126 images of four classes. The fundamental differences between detection and classification tasks Detection involves identifying regions of interest within CXR images that potentially contain abnormalities indicative of lung disease, while classification assigns a specific label to each detected abnormality, thereby determining the type of lung disease present. Lung illness classification and detection, deep learning models such as CNN ,BILSTM , and deep learning classifier. The model's accuracy is 96%.In summary, we highlight how automated categorization and detection systems have the ability to completely change the way lung illness is diagnosed and treated, leading to better patient outcomes and healthcare delivery overall.
